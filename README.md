## Context
The 80017a is a VCF/VCA module coated in resin, that is used in the channels of various vintage Roland synth such as the Juno-106. They are known to fail over time, potentially because of the resin coating. 

## Open source after market replacement

Some clone modules are available for sale, but they are either hard to find, or kind of expansive. To be honest, it's also mostly a learning opportunity for me on old synth analog design.

## Tests

Version 0.1 was assembled and tested on a Juno-106 with no (to my ears) perceivable distinction between the clone voice and the original ones. It had, however, an error in the footprint for the buffer PMOS's that was fixed with bodge wires.

Version 0.2 fixes the footprints. Not assembled and tested for now.

## Credits
- This work was motivated by a dead channel on my brother's Juno 106. Thanks for the chance to help you bro.
- It wouldn't have been possible without ressources found on the web, and especially the info given by **dksynth** and **guest** found on the following forum. Many thanks to them!
